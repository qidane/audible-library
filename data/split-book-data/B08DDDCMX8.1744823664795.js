I have been teaching Bollywood dance for more than 10 years now. Sounds like a long time BUT times flies and I still feel very young! I have shared my passion for Bollywood Dance all over the world and have been featured in many media platforms including Yahoo, <i>Business Insider,</i> etc. I am super thrilled to embark on this podcast with Audible in bringing <i>Bollywood Dance</i> to you. Dance is a great form of workout as well. You move, you invite those endorphins and you feel great! Much needed during this time. Not only will I be teaching you steps, I will be injecting lots of fun and humour and I want you to feel like I am there in person guiding you. All you need is optimism, love for dance and music and you are good to go! So let's begin!</p>";
