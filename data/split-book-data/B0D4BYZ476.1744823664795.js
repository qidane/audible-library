But there's one supernatural mystery he's never been able to solve: years ago, someone cast twin curses on him that killed his apprentices and left him bereft and isolated.<br> <br> But he's not quite alone. As Al works to solve this mystery, his friends - Buck Foi the hobgoblin, Nadia the goth queen and battle seer, and the former Irish death goddess known as the Morrigan - draw him into their own eccentric dramas and shenanigans. However, Al's being pulled in so many different directions by his colleagues, a suspicious detective, and the whims of destructive gods that he begins to wonder: will he ever find time to write his own happy ending? <br> <br> Praise for the Ink &amp; Sigil series:<br> <br> '<b>You are in for a great treat. </b><b><i>Ink &amp; Sigil</i></b><b> is great escape reading, and I loved every word'</b> Charlaine Harris, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Sookie Stackhouse books<br> <br> <b>'Will transport you right in the Scottish realm of fey and fairies . . .
