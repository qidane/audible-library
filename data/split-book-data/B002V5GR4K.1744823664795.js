window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Oscar Wilde's first play confronts the hypocrisy of public \"morality\" compared with genuine, private kindness. When it opened in 1892, <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> was an instant success and now, more than a century later, it continues to be revived frequently. The reasons for its popularity are not difficult to identify: the play's witty dialogue contains many of Wilde's most quoted aphorisms, its stylish setting provides opportunities for elegant presentation, and its cast of memorable characters play out a story which is genuinely moving. This new audio production brings together a full cast worthy of Wilde's creative genius.</p> <p>The full list of narrators includes: Samuel West, Michael Sheen, Derek Waring, Peter Yapp, Nicholas Boulton, Benjamin Soames, Rod Beacham, Emma Fielding, Sarah Badel, Elaine Claxton, Delia Paton, and Juliet Stevenson. </p>";
