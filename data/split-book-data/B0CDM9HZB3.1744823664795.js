window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p><b>STOP PRESS! </b><b><i>The Stranger Times w</i></b><b>ins the 2023 British Fantasy Award for Best Audio Work!</b></p> <p><i>Some comebacks can be murder . . .</i><br> <br> Stella is enjoying life as an almost student, or at least she is until a man falls from the sky right in front of her, leaving a big old hole in the pavement for Manchester Council to fill. The obvious question of how he ended up in the sky in the first place has no obvious answers, which is where <i>The Stranger Times</i> come in. This isn't just the hunt for another story though. Dark powers think Stella might have been involved and the only way she and the team can prove her innocence is to find out what the hell is really going on. What have dodgy gear, disturbed graves and a decommissioned rock star got to do with all this?<br> <br> Vincent Banecroft has problems of his own in the form of a tall, dark but-definitely-not-handsome man dressed like a one-man funeral who has been sent to make the paper's editor atone for his sins. Once he finds out exactly what that entails, Banecroft is not keen. Being banished to a Hellscape for all eternity looks like being no fun at all, not least because he has that pale Irish skin that burns really easily . . .<br> <br> All that plus territorial ghouls, homicidal felines, eternal (and seemingly unstoppable) gnomes and a celebrity 'Who's Who' that'd put a royal wedding to shame, and you're looking at a wild few days for <i>The Stranger Times</i>.</p> <p><i>Relight My Fire </i>is the fourth book in the acclaimed and brilliantly funny <i>Stranger Times</i> series.</p>";
