window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When George Abbershaw is invited to Black Dudley Manor for the weekend, he has only one thing on his mind - proposing to Meggie Oliphant. Unfortunately for George, things don't quite go according to plan. A harmless game turns decidedly deadly and suspicions of murder take precedence over matrimony. Trapped in a remote country house with a murderer, George can see no way out. But Albert Campion can. </p> <p>About the author: Margery Allingham was born in London in 1904. Her first novel was published when she was 17. In 1929 she published <i>The Crime at Black Dudley</i> and introduced the character who was to become the hallmark of her writing - Albert Campion.</p>";
