No sooner has the famous sleuth learnt of a decades-old murder haunting the village than a new series of killings strikes the community. </p> <p>This time the victims’ bodies are eerily arranged to allude to the lyrics of a children’s song. As the scruffy sleuth investigates, the murders continue, with a sinister, stooped old woman appearing before every new death. </p> <p>Kindaichi must unravel a tangled tale of broken hearts and blackmail to get to the truth. Can he do so before the killer reaches the final verse?</p>";
