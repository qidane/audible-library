window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> returns with an exclusive short story available only from Random House Audible! </p> <p>Holidays aren't always happy for everyone, especially for the crew at Restaurant Saint Germain. The empty dining room has more waiters than customers, the staff is grumbling about the absence of this year's Christmas bonus, and they may soon have to file a missing persons report for \"America's Sexiest Chef.\" Determined to go down kicking and screaming, two employees come up with a last ditch plan of action with a truly unexpected result. While it's not exactly a White Christmas, the crew of the Saint Germain find out that miracles can happen - even if they are accompanied by the sound of French lounge music.</p> <p>Anthony Bourdain once again brings to light the inner workings of the \"culinary underbelly\" in his bold reinvention of the traditional Christmas story. At once risqué and charming, <i>A Chef's Christmas</i> is sure to bring holiday cheer to those who make dinner and those who only make reservations.</p>";
