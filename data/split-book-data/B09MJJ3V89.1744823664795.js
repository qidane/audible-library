If we struggle, it's because we're weak and uncertain. Bruce Daisley thinks this is simply untrue, and in his new book the <i>Sunday Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Joy of Work </i>takes the notion of resilience apart, explains how it really works, and puts forward a new programme for building self-confidence and tenacity. He calls it Fortitude.</p> <p>In this book, Daisley disproves the myth that only extraordinary people are successful, shows how to achieve a sense of control through simple mind exercises, and, above all, demonstrates how we can draw on those around us to empower ourselves and build our inner-strength. Offering empirically tested advice, <i>Fortitude </i>sets out a practical path to greater self-confidence and courage, not just for the elite few, but for us all.</p>";
