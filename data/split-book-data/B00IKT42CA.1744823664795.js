window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The year is Two House and the Mexica Empire teeters on the brink of destruction, lying vulnerable to the flesh-eating star-demons – and to the return of their creator, a malevolent goddess only held in check by the Protector God’s power. The council is convening to choose a new emperor, but when a councilman is found dead, only Acatl, High Priest of the Dead, can solve the mystery. When he hears rumours of a sinister cabal of sorcerors he must face up to demons, not all of them his own.</p>";
