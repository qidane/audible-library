While other detectives bend and manipulate the law, Hammer holds it in total contempt, seeing it as nothing more than an impediment to justice, the one virtue he holds in absolute esteem. <p>Now, the no-holds-barred private eye returns, along with his gorgeous secretary, Velda, and a collection of New York City characters, in two fully dramatized \"theater-of-the-mind\" audio adventures: \"Dangerous Days\" and \"Oil and Water.\"</p> <p>Narrated by Stacy Keach, the acclaimed actor who starred in the original <i>Mike Hammer</i> television series, these new mysteries are written by the writers of that show and enhanced with a full supporting cast, sound effects, and music. Even the show's jazzy theme song is back to set the gritty tone for each episode.</p>";
