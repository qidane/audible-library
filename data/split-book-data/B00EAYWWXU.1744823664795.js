window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet Harry Dresden, Chicago's first (and only) Wizard PI. Turns out the \"everyday\" world is full of strange and magical things - and most of them don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in. </p> <p>A bargain made with the Queen of Air and Darkness has forced Dresden into a new job: professional killer. His first task is to bring death to an immortal. As if that wasn't hard enough, Dresden learns of a danger to Demonreach, the living island hidden upon Lake Michigan. A danger that could destroy billions and land Dresden in the deepest trouble he has ever known. </p> <p>Dresden has only 24 hours to gather the allies he has left and prevent a cataclysm - all while the power he bargained to get, but never meant to keep, lays siege to his very soul. Magic - it can get a guy killed. </p>";
