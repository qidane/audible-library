window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin. </b></p> <p><b>STOP PRESS! </b><b><i>The Stranger Times w</i></b><b>ins the 2023 British Fantasy Award for Best Audio Work!</b></p> <p><b>There are dark forces at work in our world (and in Manchester in particular), so thank God </b><b><i>The Stranger Times</i></b><b> is on hand to report them . . .</b><br> <br> A weekly newspaper dedicated to the weird and the wonderful (but mostly the weird), it is the go-to publication for the unexplained and inexplicable.<br> <br> At least that's their pitch. The reality is rather less auspicious. Their editor is a drunken, foul-tempered and foul-mouthed husk of a man who thinks little of the publication he edits. His staff are a ragtag group of misfits. And as for the assistant editor . . . well, that job is a revolving door - and it has just revolved to reveal Hannah Willis, who's got problems of her own.<br> <br> When tragedy strikes in her first week on the job <i>The Stranger Times</i> is forced to do some serious investigating. What they discover leads to a shocking realisation: some of the stories they'd previously dismissed as nonsense are in fact terrifyingly real. Soon they come face-to-face with darker forces than they could ever have imagined.</p> <p><i>The Stranger Times</i> is the first novel from C.K. McDonnell, the pen name of Caimh McDonnell. It combines his distinctive dark wit with his love of the weird and wonderful to deliver a joyous celebration of how truth really can be stranger than fiction.</p>";
