In an unusual family reunion, she finds Jim breaking into her cottage in the middle of the night.

When she refuses, Jim takes off again. </p> <p>Carrie finds her father again behind bars for the recent murder of Benton Parr. Who made the connection? Unbeknownst to her, Carrie's boyfriend, Dylan, an insurance investigator, has been searching for the gems. Determined to find the jewels herself, she starts examining every facet of Parr's life. She turns up a treasure trove of suspects, one of whom bashes her on the head as she's searching the victim's country cabin. </p> <p>Retreating to the quiet confines of the library where she works, Carrie watches as Smoky Joe, the resident cat, paws at a hole in the wall. Is he after the library's ghost, Evelyn, or something shinier?</p>";
