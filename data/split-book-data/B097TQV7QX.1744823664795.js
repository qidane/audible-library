window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dotson Rader arrived in New York in 1963, a young stranger to the city, knowing no one, owning nothing - until a few lucky events opened up an extraordinary new world for him. Through his words, we enter this ardent, unforgettable world of writers, artists, radicals, and sexual rebels in a time of unprecedented cultural freedom and defiance. Against the backdrop of the women's rights, gay liberation, civil rights, and anti-war movements, a singular new period of experimentation and liberation is born. Here, Dotson Rader chronicles what it was like to be young in America in the extraordinary time he calls, â€œthe glory days\". </p> <p>At the center of <i>What a Glorious Time It Was! </i>is the close friendship between Rader and celebrated American novelist Truman Capote, whose personal struggles embodied the conflict of this era: rebellion against society, body, and mind, and the cost at which it came.</p> <p>Brazen, humorous, and heartbreaking, <i>What a Glorious Time It Was! </i>appeals to memoir listeners looking to dive into remarkable lives unlike their own.</p>";
