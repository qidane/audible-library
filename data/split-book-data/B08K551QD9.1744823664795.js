The author, who went by the pen name Rex Feral, offered very specific tips for the aspiring contract killer— where to find employment, how much to charge...and how to get away with murder. Ten years later, Tiffani Horn’s mother, 8-year-old brother, and a close family friend were found murdered. The exhaustive investigation involved multi-state surveillance and wiretaps, but it wasn’t until detectives stumbled upon Hit Man that they suddenly had what they called a blueprint for the murders.
