Others save the world. </p> <p>Bob Howard is an IT expert and occasional field agent for The Laundry, the branch of Her Majesty's Secret Service that deals with occult threats. </p> <p>Dressed (grudgingly) in a tux and sent to the Caribbean, he must infiltrate a millionaire's yacht in order to prevent him violating a treaty that will start a war with an ancient underwater race. Partnered with a gorgeous American agent who's actually a soul-sucking succubus from another dimension, Bob's mission is to stop the bad guys, avoid getting the girl, and survive - shaken, perhaps, but not stirred. </p>This audiobook includes the short story <i>Pimpf</i>, and an afterword read by the author. <p></p>";
