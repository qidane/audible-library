window.bookSummaryJSON = "As a traveling man, Calvin Trillin, longtime staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, has spent a lot of time sniffing the air for the whiff of authentic hickory-wood barbecue and evading invitations to pretentious restaurants he lumps as La Maison de la Casa House, Continental Cuisine. His adventures \"trying to find something decent to eat\" have been recounted in three hilarious books: <i>American Fried</i>; <i>Alice, Let's Eat</i>; and <i>Third Helpings</i> - more recently issued in one volume as <i>The Tummy Trilogy</i>. Here, in seventeen entertaining selections that range from his efforts to write a definitive history of the Buffalo chicken wing to his attempts to lure his older daughter back from California by finding an irresistible bagel, the man Craig Claiborne called \"the Walt Whitman of American eats\" proves once again that he is among America's funniest food writers.";
