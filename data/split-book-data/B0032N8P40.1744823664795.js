window.bookSummaryJSON = "Alexander McCall Smith, best-selling author of <i>The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</i>, has turned his hand to humour. The delightful result is a creation of comic genius. For in the unnaturally tall form of Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, we are invited to meet a memorable character whose sublime insouciance is a blend of the cultivated pomposity of Frasier Crane and of Inspecteur Clouseau's hapless gaucherie. <p>Von Igelfeld inhabits the rarefied world of the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, a world he shares with his equally tall and equally ridiculous colleagues, Professors Florianus Prinzel and Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Their unlikely adventures are described in three deliciously funny instalments: <i>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</i>, <i>The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs</i>, and <i>At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances</i>.</p>";
