window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A number one Scottish crime best seller from Denzil Meyrick; James Machie was a man with a genius for violence, his criminal empire spreading beyond Glasgow into the UK and mainland Europe. </p> <p>Fortunately, James Machie is dead, assassinated in the back of a prison ambulance following his trial and conviction. But now, five years later, he is apparently back from the grave, set on avenging himself on those who brought him down. </p> <p>Top of his list is his previous associate, Frank MacDougall, who unbeknownst to D.C.I. Jim Daley, is living under protection on his lochside patch, the small Scottish town of Kinloch. Daley knows that, having been the key to Machie's conviction, his old friend and colleague D.S. Scott is almost as big a target. And nothing, not even death, has ever stood in James Machie's way.... </p>";
