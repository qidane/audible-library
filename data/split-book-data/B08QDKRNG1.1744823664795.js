window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>“I have the honour to offer up to you, thanks to the good people of Audible, a selection of some of my very favourite Wodehouse. If these stories are new to you I hope it will be the beginning of a lifelong pleasure, if some or all are familiar I hope you will welcome them like old friends.”</i> (Stephen Fry)</p> <p>Audible Studios presents this brand new performance by Stephen Fry of some of his favourite Jeeves stories from P.G. Wodehouse, with an exclusive introduction. </p> <p><i>The Jeeves Collection</i> contains:</p> <p><i>The Inimitable Jeeves</i></p> <p>A classic collection of 11 stories featuring some of the funniest episodes in the life of Bertie Wooster, gentleman, and Jeeves, his gentleman's gentleman - in which Bertie's terrifying Aunt Agatha appears, seeking whom she may devour, while Bertie's friend Bingo Little falls in love with seven different girls in succession (including the best-selling romantic novelist Rosie M. Banks). And Bertie, with Jeeves's help, hopes to evade the clutches of the terrifying Honoria Glossop. </p> <p><i>Carry On Jeeves</i></p> <p>10 more marvellous stories introduce us to Jeeves, whose first ever duty is to cure Bertie's raging hangover ('If you would drink this, sir...it is a little preparation of my own invention. It is the Worcester Sauce that gives it its colour. The raw egg makes it nutritious. The red pepper gives it its bite. Gentlemen have told me they have found it extremely invigorating after a late evening.')</p> <p><i>Right-Ho Jeeves</i></p> <p>The second full-length novel featuring Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, after <i>Thank You, Jeeves</i>. The story is mostly set at Brinkley Court, the home of Bertie's Aunt Dahlia, and introduces the recurring characters Gussie Fink-Nottle and Madeline Bassett. Bertie's friend Tuppy Glossop and cousin Angela Travers also feature in the novel, as does Brinkley Court's prized chef, Anatole.</p> <p><i>The Code of the Woosters</i></p> <p>The third full-length novel to feature Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. It introduces Sir Watkyn Bassett, the owner of a country house called Totleigh Towers, where the story takes place, and his intimidating friend Roderick Spode. It is also a sequel to <i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i>, continuing the story of Bertie's newt-fancying friend Gussie Fink-Nottle and Gussie's droopy and overly sentimental fiancée, Madeline Bassett. </p> <p><i>Joy in the Morning</i></p> <p>Bertie is persuaded to brave the home of his fearsome Aunt Agatha and her husband Lord Worplesdon, knowing that his former fiancée, the beautiful and formidably intellectual Lady Florence Craye will also be in attendance. </p> <p><b>Stephen Fry</b></p> <p>Stephen Fry is an English actor, screenwriter, author, playwright, journalist, poet, comedian, television presenter, film director and all-round national treasure. Whilst at university, Fry became involved with the Cambridge Footlights, where he met his long-time collaborator and friend Hugh Laurie. As half of the comic double act Fry and Laurie, he co-wrote and co-starred in <i>A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie</i> and <i>Jeeves and Wooster</i>.
