window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nine months of tying tourniquets and pushing new medications, of IVs, chest compressions, and defibrillator shocks - that was Kevin Grange's initiation into emergency medicine when, at age 36, he enrolled in the \"Harvard of paramedic schools\": UCLA's Daniel Freeman paramedic program, long considered one of the best and most intense paramedic training programs in the world. </p> <p>Few jobs can match the stress, trauma, and drama that a paramedic calls a typical day at the office, and few educational settings can match the pressure and competitiveness of paramedic school. Blending months of classroom instruction with ER rotations and a grueling field internship with the Los Angeles Fire Department, UCLA's paramedic program is like a mix of boot camp and med school. It would turn out to be the hardest thing Grange had ever done, but also the most transformational and inspiring. </p> <p>An in-depth look at the trials and tragedies that paramedic students experience daily, <i>Lights and Sirens</i> is ultimately about the best part of humanity - people working together to help save a human life. </p>";
