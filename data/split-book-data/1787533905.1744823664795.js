window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A BBC radio recreation of the Marx Brothers’ lost shows, starring Michael Roberts and Frank Lazarus</b></p> <p>First broadcast on America’s NBC network between 1932-33, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel charted the exploits of shady lawyer Waldorf T Flywheel (played by Groucho Marx) and his dopey assistant, Emmanuel Ravelli (played by Chico Marx). The original recordings were lost, but the scripts were rediscovered and edited by Michael Barson. These were published as <i>Flywheel, Shyster &amp; Flywheel: The Marx Brothers Lost Radio Show</i> and licensed for a dramatic adaptation by the BBC.</p> <p>Between 1990 – 92, BBC Radio 4 recorded the adaptation in front of a live studio audience. Its fast-paced and quickfire gags proved to be a hit, winning a Gold Medal at the New York International Festival in 1992.</p> <p>In this collection are the three complete radio series, produced by the award-winning Dirk Maggs (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy) and published together for the very first time. In these eighteen episodes, the duo look after a Rembrandt, try to bamboozle a millionaire, stay in a haunted mansion and join the carnival – along with many other hilarious misadventures.</p> <p><b>Michael Roberts</b> takes on Groucho’s role as Flywheel, while <b>Frank Lazarus</b> deputises for Chico as Ravelli. Among the regular cast are <b>Lorelei King</b>, <b>Graham Hoadly</b> and <b>Vincent Marzello</b>, with guest stars including <b>Spike Milligan</b> and <b>Dick Vosburgh</b>.</p> <p>Produced by Dirk Maggs</p> <p>A BBC Studios production</p>";
