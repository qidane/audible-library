They reminded me that I was on a tiny island. And I was trapped.</i></p> <p>There has never been a murder on Alderney.</p> <p>It's a tiny island, just three miles long and a mile and a half wide. The perfect location for a brand-new literary festival. Private investigator Daniel Hawthorne has been invited to talk about his new book. The writer, Anthony Horowitz, travels with him.</p> <p>Very soon they discover that not all is as it should be. Alderney is in turmoil over a planned power line that will cut through it, desecrating a war cemetery and turning neighbour against neighbour.</p> <p>The visiting authors - including a blind medium, a French performance poet and a celebrity chef - seem to be harbouring any number of unpleasant secrets.</p> <p>When the festival's wealthy sponsor is found brutally killed, Alderney goes into lockdown and Hawthorne knows that he doesn't have to look too far for suspects.</p> <p>There's no escape. The killer is still on the island. And there's about to be a second death....</p>";
