Barrister-in-training.</b><br> <br> When hero policeman Grant Cliveden dies from a poisoning in the Old Bailey, it threatens to shake the country to its core.<br> <br> The evidence points to one man. Jimmy Knight has been convicted of multiple offences before and defending him will be no easy task. Not least because this is trainee barrister Adam Green's first case.<br> <br> But it will quickly become clear that Jimmy Knight is not the only person in Cliveden's past with an axe to grind.<br> <br> The only thing that's certain is that this is a trial which will push Adam - and the justice system itself - to the limit . . .</p>";
