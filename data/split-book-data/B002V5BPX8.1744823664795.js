window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Simon Jones, who played Arthur Dent in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, presents a look back at the life and work of a writer who has captivated the imagination of millions. </p> <p>When Douglas Adams created <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> for BBC Radio 4, it was the genesis of a science fiction comedy legend. Yet his career at the BBC had begun in Light Entertainment, with contributions to <i>The Burkiss Way</i>, <i>Week Ending</i>, and other sketch shows of the time. He went on to script edit a series of <i>Doctor Who</i>, and to write a series of <i>Hitchhiker</i> and <i>Dirk Gently</i> books. </p> <p>In programme, Simon Jones takes an A-Z look at Douglas Adams's career, taking in extracts from the many radio and TV programmes he contributed to. These include personal appearances on <i>Wogan</i>, <i>Tomorrow's World</i>, and <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, his own radio programmes such as <i>Last Chance to See</i> (about the search for endangered species) and <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Future</i> (a look at impending technology), and even a 'lost' segment of <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> which Adams wrote specially for Radio 4's Steafel Plus in 1982. Also included are some of the many tributes paid to Adams following his untimely death in May 2001. </p> <p>This is a fascinating and in-depth audio biography of a man whose brilliant work has inspired, enraptured, and entertained millions of people worldwide.</p>";
