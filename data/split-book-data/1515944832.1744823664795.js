window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First in the Irish Century historical fiction series, <i>1916: A Novel of the Irish Rebellion</i> begins the saga of the Halloran family during Ireland's long struggle for independence.</p> <p>At age 15, Ned Halloran lost both of his parents - and almost his own life - when the <i>Titanic</i> sank. Determined to keep what little he has, he returns to his homeland of Ireland and enrolls at Saint Edna's school in Dublin. Saint Edna's headmaster is the renowned scholar and poet Patrick Pearse - who is soon to gain greater fame as a rebel and patriot. Ned becomes deeply involved with the growing revolution...and the sacrifices it will demand.</p> <p>Through Ned's eyes, Morgan Llywelyn's <i>1916 </i>examines the Irish fight for freedom - inspired by poets and schoolteachers, fueled by a desperate desire for independence, and played out in the historic streets of Dublin against the background of World War I. It is a story of the brave men and heroic women who, for a few unforgettable days, managed to hold out against the might of the British Empire.</p>";
