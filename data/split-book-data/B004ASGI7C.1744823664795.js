window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The novels of Iain M. Banks have forever changed the face of modern science fiction. His Culture books combine breathtaking imagination with exceptional storytelling, and have secured his reputation as one of the most extraordinary and influential writers in the genre.</b><br> War rages across the galaxy. Billions have died, billions more are doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, face cold-blooded, brutal destruction. The Idirans ­fight for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles are at stake. There can be no surrender.<br> <br> Within this cosmic conflict, a crucial battle of wits is waged. Deep within a fabled labyrinth, on a Planet of the Dead forbidden to mortals, lies a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans desperately seek it. It is the fate of Horza, the Changer, and his motley crew of unpredictable mercenaries, human and machine, to actually ­find it - and with it their own destruction.<br> <br> <b>The Culture series:</b><br> <i>Consider Phlebas</i><br> <i>The Player of Games</i><br> <i>Use of Weapons</i><br> <i>Excession</i><br> <i>Inversions</i><br> <i>Look to Windward</i><br> <i>Matter</i><br> <i>Surface Detail</i><br> <i>The Hydrogen Sonata</i><br> <i>The State of the Art</i><br> <br> <b>Other books by Iain M.
