window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here are six extraordinary adventures, never revealed before, starring Simon Callow as Sherlock Holmes and Nicky Henson as Dr Watson, written by John Taylor. </p> <p></p> <li>\"The Wandering Corpse\": The professor claimed he knew how to resurrect the dead. Now he's dead and his body's missing from the coffin.</li> <li>\"The Horror in Hanging Wood\": The victim's arm has been wrenched half off, face battered out of all recognition. Who, or what, could have made such a ferocious attack?</li> <li>\"The Paddington Witch\": Saul Ransome's body was cooked like meat and black as coal. But \"Garth Ransome is saying his brother was witched - that it was Bess that witched him.\"</li> <li>\"The Phantom Organ\": The night that Hugh Hembury was killed, a note was nailed on the church notice board: \"Now is the hunter hunted. H H shall be first.\"</li> <li>\"The Devil's Tunnel\": A young woman disappears from a train as it speeds through a tunnel, and only her hat and one shoe are found. Surely too few clues, even for Sherlock Holmes.</li> <li>\"The Battersea Worm\": The Tower was Angel Holland's fortress. The only way to Holland's room at the top was by the passenger elevator, and Dr Watson was the only person who had used the lift the day she was murdered. <p></p></li>";
