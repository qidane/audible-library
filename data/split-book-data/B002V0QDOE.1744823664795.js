She's just been pushed overboard from a cruise liner by Chaz, her scumbag husband, and survived to tell the tale. <p> But rather than reporting the crime to the police, she decides to stay dead and instead of getting mad, get even.</p> <p> Filled with a host of endearingly offbeat characters, and a narrative that is hilarious, romantic, and thought-provoking by turns, <i>Skinny Dip</i> takes us on a journey through the warped politics of southern Florida, and through the madness created by the human heart.</p>";
