window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set in modern day Moscow, <i>Night Watch</i> is a world as elaborate and imaginative as Tolkien or the best Asimov. Living among us are the \"Others,\" an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light. A thousand-year treaty has maintained the balance of power, and the two sides coexist in an uneasy truce. But an ancient prophecy decrees that one supreme \"Other\" will rise up and tip the balance, plunging the world into a catastrophic war between the Dark and the Light.</p> <p>When a young boy with extraordinary powers emerges, fulfilling the first half of the prophecy, will the forces of the Light be able to keep the Dark from corrupting the boy and destroying the world?</p>";
