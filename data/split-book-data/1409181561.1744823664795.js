window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The new Rivers of London novella, from </b><b><i>Sunday Times</i></b><b> number one best-selling author Ben Aaronovitch.</b></p> <p><b>Ghost hunter, fox whisperer, troublemaker.</b></p> <p>It is the summer of 2013, and Abigail Kamara has been left to her own devices. This might, by those who know her, be considered a mistake. While her cousin, police constable and apprentice wizard Peter Grant, is off in the sticks, chasing unicorns, Abigail is chasing her own mystery. Teenagers around Hampstead Heath have been going missing but before the police can get fully engaged, the teens return home - unharmed but vague about where they've been.</p> <p>Aided only by her new friend Simon, her knowledge that magic is real, and a posse of talking foxes that think they're spies, Abigail must venture into the wilds of Hampstead to discover who is luring the teenagers and more importantly - why?</p>";
