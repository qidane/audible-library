window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With more than one million copies in print, <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i> was the surprise publishing phenomenon of 2009. A best seller on three continents, PPZ has been translated into 21 languages and optioned to become a major motion picture.</p> <p>In this terrifying and hilarious prequel, we witness the genesis of the zombie plague in early 19th-century England. We watch Elizabeth Bennet evolve from a naive young teenager into a savage slayer of the undead. We laugh as she begins her first clumsy training with nunchucks and katana swords and cry when her first blush with romance goes tragically awry.</p> <p>Written by acclaimed novelist (and Edgar Award nominee) Steve Hockensmith, <i>Dawn of the Dreadfuls</i> invites Austen fans to step back into Regency England, Land of the Undead! </p>";
