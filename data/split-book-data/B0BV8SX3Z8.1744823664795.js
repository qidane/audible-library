window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Completely Psmith</p> <p>By P G. Wodehouse</p> <p>Narrated by Graham Scott</p> <p>The complete career of the immaculate Psmith! First, as a fellow lost lamb with cricket prodigy Mike Jackson at Sedleigh school; then shaking up the world of commerce in his genial efforts to reform boorish bank manager Mr. Bickersdyke; and later converting twee family periodical \"Cosy Moments\" into a crusading yellow journal, in pursuit of the bashful owner of New York's notorious Pleasant Street tenements. And finally following distressed damsel Eve to Blandings Castle—the seat of fluffy-minded peer Lord Emsworth—in the guise of an absconded Canadian poet, and (from the best of motives) becoming embroiled in a plot to steal Lady Constance Keeble's fabulous diamond necklace...</p>";
