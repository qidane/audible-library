window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ah, remember ye olde days when the family would gather around the giant Philco radio and listen to serials? You don’t? We don’t either. But apparently that’s how Cinnamon Bear was born on November 26, 1937, as the star of a holiday season cliff-hanger-style children’s radio series. We hear it was quite the rage!</p> <p>Well, that was then. Now a whole new series, <i>The Cinnamon Bear: A Holiday Adventure</i> is being brought to life by an all-star cast, and it ain’t your grandpappy’s spiced eggnog. For starters, Jimmy and Judy, those ridiculously naïve kids from the original, are now skeptical, savvy, and sarcastic little buggers (hey, parents - sound familiar?). They follow the magical Cinnamon Bear (Alan Cumming) on an out-of-this-world trek to find their lost (or stolen!) tree-topping star. Along the way, they’ll encounter some bizarre (and hilarious) characters, including Mr. Presto the Magician (John Goodman), the Crazy Quilt Dragon (Stephen Root), and - spoiler alert! - Santa Claus himself (Ryan Reynolds). Mix in a playful score by cofounder of the Pogues James Fearnley, and you’ve got a deliciously rich and rewarding holiday experience kids and parents will love.</p> <p><b>Performed by a full cast, including:</b></p> <p>· Michael Arden </p> <p>· Craig Bierko </p> <p>· Rocky Carroll</p> <p>· Alan Cumming</p> <p>· Rachel Dratch</p> <p>· Bridget Everett</p> <p>· Dan Finnerty</p> <p>· Johnny Galecki</p> <p>· Ana Gasteyer</p> <p>· Nancy Giles</p> <p>· Eric Gilliland </p> <p>· John Goodman</p> <p>· Marcia Gay Harden</p> <p>· Ed Herbstman </p> <p>· Melanie Hoopes</p> <p>· Helen Hunt</p> <p>· Catherine Keener</p> <p>· Thomas Lennon</p> <p>· Camryn Manheim </p> <p>· Milo Manheim</p> <p>· Ari Melber</p> <p>· Andy Mientus </p> <p>· John Cameron Mitchell </p> <p>· Chris Parnell</p> <p>· Martha Plimpton</p> <p> · Ryan Reynolds</p> <p>· Stephen Root</p> <p>· Romy Rosemont </p> <p>· Lakshmi Singh </p> <p>· Sarah Vowell</p>";
