window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Harry is the best and technically the 'only' at what he does, being the lone professional wizard PI in the Chicago phonebook. So when the Chicago PD has cases that transcend mortal capabilities, they come to him for answers. </p> <p>For the 'everyday' world is actually full of strange and magical things - and most of them don't play well with humans. Yet despite his precautions, Harry tends to stumble from crisis to drama in his dealings with the supernatural world - call it an occupational hazard. </p> <p>Here, he unfailingly manages to get on the wrong side of werewolf, fae, and vampires alike. And that's where his own rather special powers come into play.... </p> <p>These bite-sized stories are tremendously entertaining and will leave you itching to explore more of Harry Dresden's world. And as well as eight short stories, this collection includes an all-new Dresden Files novella. </p>";
