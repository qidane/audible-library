window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Matthew Scudder investigates the brutal murder of a woman known as the “bag lady.” A seemingly homeless woman, she turns out to have distributed her substantial wealth in a complex will naming random strangers. Where did the money come from? Why was she living in such reduced circumstances? And why in the world did she choose these beneficiaries—the owner of a local newspaper stand, a neighbor she rarely spoke to, the detective himself—when her real friends and acquaintances got nothing at all? And how is all this linked to her murder?</p>";
