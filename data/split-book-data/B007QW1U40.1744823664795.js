window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Weber himself contributes three never-before-published excursions into Honor's world, among them the story of how she first discovered her own inner strength and courage; and a chapter in the history of the telepathic treecats, who form a bond with their chosen human that can only be severed by death. Roland Green, author of the Starcruiser Shenandoah series and the Peace Company series, delivers a hardhitting tale of conflict between Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven. Linda Evans, co-author of <i>Time Scout</i>, explores life with the treecats before Honor came. And Jane Lindskold, author of <i>Brother to Dragons, Companion to Owls</i>, tells how Honor's Queen, Elizabeth III, had to learn the hard way what monarchy was all about.</p>";
