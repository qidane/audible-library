window.bookSummaryJSON = "Hard-boiled ex-cop Tony Valentine has a new profession: spotting casino cheats and exposing a casino's flaws to the owners. Now he must unravel the mystery of an amateur player impossibly raking in the dough on blackjack. However, his investigation stirs up a hornet's nest worth of problems. First of all, the suspect bears a distinct resemblance to Valentine's late wife; second, she's captured on a video surveillance tape with Valentine's lifelong enemy; third, his son Gerry is also in Las Vegas, getting lessons in illegal card-counting. Valentine now sees a new breed of criminal in Vegas, one who is not after money but, instead, is after maximum destruction of human life. It's up to Tony to stop the killings, or risk losing everything he holds dear.";
