window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s rumoured that Dickens wanted to return to his classic novel <i>Oliver Twist</i>, to bring him back into a later book as an older character, but he never managed this before he died. However, if Oliver had returned, what would he have been like? Would the scars of his childhood affect the man he would become? And what of ‘Dodger’, sent to a land halfway around the world, his friend, mentor and master dead because of Oliver? </p> <p><i>Dodge &amp; Twist</i> is that story. The tale of two boys, 12 years later, returning into each other’s lives - for both good and bad.</p> <p>Featuring: Matt Addis, Ben Addis, Tom Michael Blyth, Will Brown, Trevor Cooper, Alexandra Donnachie, Lauren Drummond, Nigel Fairs, David Gooderson, Tom Goodman-Hill, Harry Hepple, Will Howard, James Joyce, Anthony Keetch, Mack Keith-Roach, Matt Lucas, Nick Lucas, Stephen Mangan, William McGeough, David Menkin, Harry Myers,Matty Norgren, Greg Patmore, Miles Richardson, Richard Rycroft, Andy Secombe, Michael Socha, Sheila Steafel, Kara Tointon, Lizzie Waterworth-Santo and Sarah Whitehouse.</p>";
