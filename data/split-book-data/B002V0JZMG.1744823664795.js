window.bookSummaryJSON = "When the low-budget biker movie <i>Easy Rider</i> shocked Hollywood with its success in 1969, a new Hollywood era was born. This was an age when talented filmmakers such as Scorcese, Coppola, and Spielberg, along with a new breed of actors, including DeNiro, Pacino, and Nicholson, became the powerful figures who would make such modern classics as <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and <i>Jaws</i>. <p><i>Easy Rider, Raging Bulls</i> follows the wild ride that was Hollywood in the 70s - an unabashed celebration of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll (both on screen and off) and a climate where innovation and experimentation reigned supreme.</p>";
