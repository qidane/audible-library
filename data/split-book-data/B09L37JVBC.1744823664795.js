window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Starship Captain George Cottonhammer (Will Forte), bored by his job, stops his ship in middle space and floats, doing nothing. He refuses to answer distress calls, dodges anything that smacks of work, chooses instead to focus on his love life and his idea dujour - opening an intergalactic burger franchise. And while he perfects the art of killing time, his crew moves from baffled to annoyed, to furious, to borderline mutinous. But when an ignored intergalactic distress call turns out to be a trap, the limits of how high someone can fail upwards are stretched, and the captain must, to his dismay, do something.</p>";
