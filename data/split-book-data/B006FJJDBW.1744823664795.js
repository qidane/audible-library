window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, Audio Drama, 2013</b></p> <p><b>Award-winning author, narrator, and screenwriter Neil Gaiman personally selected this book, and, using the tools of the Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX), cast the narrator and produced this work for his audiobook label, Neil Gaiman Presents. </b></p> <p><b>A few words from Neil on <i>Swordspoint:</i></b> \"It's as if Jane Austen wrote fantasy... an imaginary world where the characters are real people: a Vanity Fair of aristocrats, rogues, orphans, and heroes; a book where the best swordsman in the land can make far more money dueling at private parties than he can as a knight-errant. Ellen Kushner casts her sharp eye over them all, but with great affection and lavish detaiI.... couldn't think of a better performer for <i>Swordspoint</i> than Ellen, and her reading is polished, intimate, and – since Riverside is of her creation – wholly authentic. </p> <p>\"What really makes this production of <i>Swordspoint</i> unique, though, is the supporting cast in this special \"illuminated production\". Several key scenes are fully dramatized, and throughout the entire book's soundscapes you will hear the cadences of the marketplace, the music of the drawing rooms, and of course the ring of steel drawn from the scabbard. Ellen actually wrote new dialogue for the crowd scenes, so the actors aren't just mumbling \"rhubarb rhubarb\" to simulate speech.... You'll be able to hear performances from acclaimed and award-winning actors, including Dion Graham, Katherine Kellgren, Robert Fass, Nick Sullivan, and the remarkable Simon Jones.\" </p> <p><b>In this exciting new \"illuminated production\", the author herself reads her own work, supported by a full cast.</b> Author Ellen Kushner is also a popular performer and National Public Radio host (<i>Sound &amp; Spirit</i>). For years, fans have been asking her to record her own audiobook of <i>Swordspoint</i>. To mark the 25th anniversary of the book's publication, Ellen teamed up with Sue Zizza of SueMedia Productions, known for her signature touches of soundscapes and sound effects, multi-voiced dramatizations, and all the techniques of \"illuminated production\". Together they have made <i>Swordspoint</i> a brand-new audio experience, in which the full supporting cast dramatizes and illuminates key scenes from Ellen's compelling narration. </p> <p>On the streets of Riverside, a man lives and dies by the sword. Even the nobles on the Hill turn to duels to settle their disputes. And in this city, the swordsman Richard St. Vier is the undisputed master, as skilled as he is ruthless – until a death by the sword is met with outrage instead of awe, and the city discovers that the line between hero and villain can be altered in the blink of an eye. Because every man lives at sword's point, if you can only find his weakness. And even the greatest swordsman in Riverside has one thing he cares for deeply. </p> <p>Hailed by critics as \"a bravura performance, a delight from start to finish\" (<i>Locus</i>), \"intelligent, humorous and dramatic\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) and \"witty, beguiling and ingenious\" (<i>Interzone</i>) , Kushner's \"Melodrama of Manners\" has become a classic, a favorite not only of Neil Gaiman but a host of distinguished colleagues, including George R. R. Martin (\"unforgettable!\"), Orson Scott Card (\"powerful\") and Gene Wolfe (\"as if Noel Coward had written a vehicle for Errol Flynn!\"). </p> <p>The artwork used for the audiobook edition of <i>Swordspoint</i> is based on the artwork and design by Thomas Canty for the original first US edition of the book.</p>";
