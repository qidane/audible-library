As his personal life crumbles around him, he devotes his life to his work, all the while trying to crack the secret of his curse. </p> <p>But when his latest apprentice, Gordie, turns up dead in his Glasgow flat, Al discovers evidence that Gordie was living a secret life of crime. Now Al is forced to play detective - while avoiding actual detectives who are wondering why death seems to always follow Al. Investigating his apprentice's death will take him through Scotland's magical underworld and he'll need the help of a mischievous hobgoblin if he's to survive. </p> <p><b>Packed to the brim with mystery, magic and mayhem, </b><b><i>Ink &amp; Sigil</i></b><b> is perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Rivers of London</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Rotherweird</i></b><b>.</b> </p>";
